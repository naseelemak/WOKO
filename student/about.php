            <p class="text-justify">In 2018, a student noticed how troublesome it was for lecturers to promote competitions to students. Channels used for promotion included Webspace, lab computer wallpapers, and class-to-class pitches. A lot of time was wasted on students who didn't even care about what was being said.</p>
            
            <p class="text-justify">The observation drove the student to develop a website that would make it much easier for lecturers to push competitions to students who are interested in competing â€“ students passionate about learning and testing what they've learnt beyond classrooms walls.</p>
            
            <p class="text-justify">That website is WOKO.</p>
